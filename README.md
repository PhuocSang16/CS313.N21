This is a course project for Data Mining and Application of UIT

Topic: Factors affecting students' process English results.

Idea: From available data of UIT students, to filter out factors that can be used to evaluate whether students' English meets process standards. From there, the team built a classifier machine learning model to determine whether students' English levels in the final year meet the requirements or not.
